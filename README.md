# 113th Congress Twitter Accounts

**NOTE**: These are taken directly from http://stuffthought.com/blog/?p=686, so
all credit goes to Adi, who compiled them.

Currently the [legislators-social-media.yaml file](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/blob/master/legislators-social-media.yaml)
in the repo that the Sunlight Foundation Congress API pulls from was missing various
representatives' accounts (most likely because some accounts are fuzzy whether they are run by a campaign or official staff).
